# online shopping portal
A shopping portal where sellers can sell their products, people can buy them and track their orders. (Under development).

The e commerce portal was made using php & sql and has pretty minimal frontend design.

## Requirements
1. Apache server for running php
2. MySql for the database

*Install XAMPP which comes with apache and mysql, it reduces the hassale of installing different software packages.*

## Setup
1. Put the repository in your public directory of your Apache server.
2. Create a database in MySql with the name `shopdb`.
3. Import the `shopdb.sql` file from the repository to MySql database which you just created.
4. Make sure Apache and MySql is running and render the `index.php` file or simply go to the url `localhost/DIRECTORY_NAME`
